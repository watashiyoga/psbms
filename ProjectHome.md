The smart BMS (Inventory and Point of Sale software) is a portable and perfect system<br>
for small and medium size businesses. It is built on web technologies (Php, MySQL)<br>
and runs on Apache web server.<br>
This is fully plug and play, can run standalone on a single PC or in a network<br>
environment with multiple client connections. Very portable meaning it runs on USB,<br>
External Hard Drives, and can also be installed directly to drive C. All related server<br>
components have been compiled and bundle in one package and with a single click of the<br>
mouse; you start all servers and lunch the BMS application.<br>
The system is full-time crash proof meaning when your computer system crashes, you<br>
just remove the USB/External HD and plug in another computer and in a couple of<br>
seconds, you are ready to go with all your business data.</blockquote>
